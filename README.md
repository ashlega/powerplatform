This is a bit of an experiment, but, on the other hand, I think it might turn into a useful project - we'll see how it goes.. 

PowerPlatform has been evolving quickly - it's hard to keep track of everything, but there are a couple of things which do affect us all the time unless we are aware of them:

1. Issues we don't know about
2. Actions we need to take that we did not plan for

So this is going to be a repository of issues and actions - there will be no Code. If you are aware of an issue, feel free to submit it. We'll be tracking those issues and we'll be closing them once they have been resolved. Apparently, it is supposed to be a community effort, so, likewise, if you see an issue that you know has already been resolved, make sure to add a note.

Sounds simple.. let's see how it works out!
