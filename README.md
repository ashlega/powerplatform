## PowerPlatform Tracker

PowerPlatform has been evolving quickly - it's hard enough to keep track of all the changes, and it would be really helpful if we could quickly identify a few things:

1. Issues we don't know about
2. Actions we need to take that we did not plan for
3. Usage scenarios we did not think about

So what if we could see those issues, actions, and scenarios in one place?

This experimental project is meant to serve just that purpose - there will be no Code here.

### If you are aware of an issue or upcoming action, feel free to submit either of those as an issue. 

We'll be tracking those issues and we'll be closing them once/if we see they have been resolved. Apparently, it is supposed to be a community effort, so, likewise, if you see an issue that you know has already been resolved, make sure to add a note.

- When submitting an issue, make sure to include the keywords so others could easily find them
- When submitting an "action" issue , make sure to add "due date" right to the title in the YYYY-MM-DD format
- And, finally, make sure to label those issues as either an "issue" or an "upcoming action"

### If you have an interesting usage scenario that's not obvious, we'd like to add it as a wiki page

Get in touch, we will add you as a collaborator to this repo, and you'll be able to create wiki pages here.

Sounds simple? Let's make it work!

PS. And for those folks who would rather stay anonymous.. you are more than welcome to submit your issues through this web form: http://www.itaintboring.com/about/
