## PowerPlatform Issues and Upcoming Actions

PowerPlatform has been evolving quickly - it's hard enugh to keep track of all the changes, but there are a couple of things which do affect us all unless we are aware of them:

1. Issues we don't know about
2. Actions we need to take that we did not plan for

So what if we could see those issues and actions in one place?

This experimental project is meant to serve just that purpose - there will be no Code here, but, if you are aware of an issue or upcoming action, feel free to submit either of those as an issue. 

We'll be tracking those issues and we'll be closing them once/if we see they have been resolved. Apparently, it is supposed to be a community effort, so, likewise, if you see an issue that you know has already been resolved, make sure to add a note.

Sounds simple.. let's see how it works out!
